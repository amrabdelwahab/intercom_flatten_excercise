# NestedArray Flatten Exercise

## Problem Description

You can check the entire context [here](https://blog.intercom.com/how-we-hire-engineers-part-1/) but this exercise is aiming to flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. e.g. `[[1,2,[3]],4] -> [1,2,3,4]`. 

 If the language you're using has a function to flatten arrays, you should pretend it doesn't exist.
